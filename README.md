# TriviaGame
1. the trivia game is a timed quiz which automatically goes to the next question after displaying the answer to the previous question.
It was created as an exercise in using interval methods with javascript and jquery. It is useful for perhaps picking up a few random facts you didn't already know, or digging into the code of how these quizzes work if you are an aspiring developer. 
2. press anywhere on the page to start the quiz. each question has one correct answer and three incorrect answers.
3. if you have any problem using the quiz, please contact the creator, Matthew Dwinell. This project and all subsequent edits to the project are property of Matthew Dwinell.
